I think a common misconception with millennials entering the workforce is that we are too entitled for a hard-days work, we want everything easy, or we are just not interested in working in general. I believe the issue is that our generation has been inundated with a wealth of technology and information that it piques our interest in a multitude of fields. Everything we want to know or learn can be found in a few seconds on our phones or computers. This plethora of knowledge by no means is a negative, but it makes it hard to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life.

This is where I fall in, an abundance of interests and hobbies, but an indecisiveness to choose which to turn into a career. I started in college as an electrical engineer, then switched to mechanical engineering, and then to production. I could not make up my mind, and I don't know if you know this, but college is not cheap. With a withering college fund, and a revolving door of majors, I knew it was time to just pick something I'm interested in, has good job security, and can make a good salary. 

I am a very-left brained, analytical person, with almost no artistic ability. I once drew a stick figure that was called "adequate" by an art teacher. So that eliminated all the arts for me. As for liberal arts fields that don't require artistic talent, the volatility and uncertainty of job prospects put me off. 

Finally, we get to the software development. For as long as I can remember I have always loved building, creating, experimenting, and tinkering with things. At its most basic level that's what software development is. You build and create applications, websites, games and more. You tinker with your code and other peoples code to see how it can be optimized and enhanced. You experiment with code to see how changing the logic and layout will produce varying results. Contrary to what I'm sure most non-coders think, everyone has their own style of code. While there are common practices and syntactic sugar to follow, everyone has their own way to implement their logic. Software Development encompasses everything I'm interested in, while still allowing for individualistic freedoms (within reason). That, plus the continued transition into automation and AI, and the ever-expanding role technology plays in our lives means there will always be a need for software developers.
